# Status: Every exercise completed (two with minor drawbacks;
- 1: No test-database created --> main database used for testing --> tests based on inserting into the database aren't tested due to not knowing how to setup/tear down a new database before/after each test.
- 2: No tests made since the creation of the test-database was very troublesome (testing was optional for this exercise).
