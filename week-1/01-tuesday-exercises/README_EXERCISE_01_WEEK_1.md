#### Project: "customer", status: Completed (optional JUnit exercise not done).
- I tried making the testing work but struckled a lot with setting up/tearing down a test-database before/after each test. Since it was an optional exercise, I gave up in the end.
- Where to find the commit: I've only commited one time (after everything worked), so: "Week1 uploaded".
