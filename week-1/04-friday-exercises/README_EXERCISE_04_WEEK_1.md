#### Project: "jparestanddto", status: Completed (JUnit hasn't got a test-database, uses the main database).
- Where to find the commit: I've only commited the code one time (after everything worked), so: "Week1 work pushed".
- Link to deployed code: http://104.248.29.142:8081/jparesponddto/
  - /api/bankcustomer/{id}
  - /api/bankcustomer/all
- Tests in JUnit use the main database (I had problems with setting up/tearing down a test-database before/after each test):
  - Test of adding a bankcustomer to the database is written but not tested, due to the above struggle.
