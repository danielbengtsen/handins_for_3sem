# handins_3sem
### Use:
#### - This is the folder in which I will upload all my hand ins on this 3rd term. 
#### - There will be a folder containing the exercises of the week seperated in folders from each exercise day (example: "week-1" --> "01-tuesday-exercises"):
- "week-1" contains everything that's been made in NetBeans during week 1. "01-tuesday-exercises" contains the exercises from tuesday (01 means that it's the first exercise day of the week).
- Inside of each "week" folder, there will also be a "other" folder. This contains all the code written during the week that wasn't part of the exercises (so if I've forgotten to add an exercise to the day folders, it'll be in the "other" folder).
